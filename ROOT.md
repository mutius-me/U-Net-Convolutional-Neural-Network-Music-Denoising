### root

This is the root directory of the project.



In this directory:

- `dataset` is a subdirectory that contains all iterations of the dataset generation and treatment pipeline, as well the raw data used in each iteration. However, in order to keep the exported repository lightweight, the actual raw data is not included with the export. To learn how to generate a dataset, please see `./generating-a-dataset.md`.
- `myenv` is a subdirectory that contains the virtual environment to run this Python project. `myenv` is not included in the exported project repository, and must be generated by the user. Instructions for creating the `myenv` directory are in `./README.md`.
- `model` is a subdirectory that contains the Jupyter notebooks used to train and run the U-Net model.
  -  Each iteration in the `model` subdirectory corresponds to a dataset iteration in the `dataset` subdirectory: a model from a particular iteration should only be used with dataset from that iteration.
  - Each iteration contains different versions of the model. The last version is the most up-to-date.
- `setup` is a subdirectory that contains `requirements.txt`, a file used to generate `myenv`.
- `utilities` is a subdirectory that contains general utility scripts used in development, but not explicitly used for dataset generation.
