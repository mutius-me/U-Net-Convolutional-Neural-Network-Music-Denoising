# Future improvements

- Experiment further with the model
  - Bigger dataset; more compute needed?
  
  - change hyperparameters?
  
  - Dynamic noise?
  
    


- Ensure high bit-depth (float-32) throughout the project
  - Verify noise attenuation
  - Verify noisy script mixing
- Add documentation at the top of every file with a description of its function, as well as filling out README documents for each subdirectory.
- Fix existing, outdated documentation in both modules and READMEs

- Replace absolute paths with relative paths throughout codebase in order to make project fully exportable

- Synthesize (combine) scripts in the `utility` subdirectory that can be synthesized, to avoid clutter
