# Senior Project

Describe your project here. A brief description of what it does and who it's for.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For example:



```
Python 3.9 or higher Anaconda (optional, but recommended for managing environments)
```



### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

A step by step series of commands that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

For Unix/macOS: 

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

For Windows:

```
python -m venv myenv
```



2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

For Unix/macOS:

source myenv/bin/activate

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

myenv\Scripts\activate

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```



### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### Running the Application

Explain how to run the application. For example:

```
TBA
```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```
deactivate
```

(If using Anaconda, use `conda deactivate` to exit the base environment.)
