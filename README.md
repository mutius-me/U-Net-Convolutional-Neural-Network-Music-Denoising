# README: U-Net Denoising Model

A Senior Project presented to the faculty of the Department of Computer Science of Yale University In candidacy for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Computing & the Arts.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### System & software requirements

This project has been tested only using the prerequisites listed below. 

- Python 3.12.2 or higher



### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

A step by step series of commands that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

For Unix/macOS: 

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

For Windows:

```
python -m venv myenv
```



2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

For Unix/macOS:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```



### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies using the requirements.txt file, which is located in `setup` subdirectory of the root directory.

```
cd setup && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Explain how to run the application. For example:

```
TBA
```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```
deactivate
